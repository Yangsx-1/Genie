Genie â€“ A Lightweight Serverless Infrastructure For In-Memory Key-Value Caching With Fine-Grained And Prompt Elasticity

Genie is a lightweight serverless infrastructure for in-memory key-value caching with fine-grained and immediate elasticity.
In Genie, a novel approach is adopted to enable dynamic and independent resource allocation to multiple tenants. 
It processes all arrived requests and estimates the vCPU consumption with a lightweight machine-learning approach for fine-grained billing. 
Moreover, Genie estimates the working set of each tenant and dynamically resizes the allocated memory to guarantee the hit ratio requirements.
Evaluation results show that CPU estimation can be achieved at an interval of every 100 microseconds with almost no impact on system performance.
Besides, it could resize the memory capacity in a few seconds at megabytes level according to the calculated memory size.
The holistic design incurs 1%-2% performance degradation compared to our baseline.
Moreover, Genie achieves an average of 58.3% CPU and 49.9% memory savings compared to AsparaDB for Memcache.

Requirements
------------

 * Linux x86\_64 >= 3.0
 * Intel CPU >= Sandy Bridge (Haswell or more recent recommended)
 * Hugepage (2 GiB) support

Dependencies for compilation
----------------------------

 * g++ >= 5.3
 * cmake >= 2.8
 * make >= 3.81
 * libnuma-dev >= 2.0
 * libcurl-dev >= 7.35
 * DPDK >= 16.11
 * libsqlite3-dev >= 3.0 (with -DSQLITE=ON)

Dependencies for execution
--------------------------

 * bash >= 4.0
 * python >= 3.4

 For example, if we adopt 40 as client and 36 as server, the etcd command should be as follows:

 36:
 ```
 etcd --name infra0 --initial-advertise-peer-urls http://10.176.64.36:2380 \
  --listen-peer-urls http://10.176.64.36:2380 \
  --listen-client-urls http://10.176.64.36:2379,http://127.0.0.1:2379 \
  --advertise-client-urls http://10.176.64.36:2379 \
  --initial-cluster-token etcd-cluster-1 \
  --initial-cluster infra0=http://10.176.64.36:2380,infra1=http://10.176.64.40:2380 \
  --initial-cluster-state new
```

40:
```
etcd --name infra1 --initial-advertise-peer-urls http://10.176.64.40:2380 \
  --listen-peer-urls http://10.176.64.40:2380 \
  --listen-client-urls http://10.176.64.40:2379,http://127.0.0.1:2379 \
  --advertise-client-urls http://10.176.64.40:2379 \
  --initial-cluster-token etcd-cluster-1 \
  --initial-cluster infra0=http://10.176.64.36:2380,infra1=http://10.176.64.40:2380 \
  --initial-cluster-state new
```

Compiling DPDK
--------------

         * cd dpdk-16.11
         * make config T=x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc
         # Optimization: try to increase "CONFIG_RTE_MEMPOOL_CACHE_MAX_SIZE" to 4096 in build/.config (but it can also break mempool initialization)
         * make -j

Compiling Genie
--------------

         * cd Genie/build
         * ln -s ../../dpdk-16.11 ./dpdk
         * cmake ..
         * make -j

Setting up the general environment
----------------------------------

         * cd Genie/build
         * ln -s src/mica/test/*.json .
         * ../script/setup.sh 8192 8192    # 2 NUMA nodes, 16 Ki pages (32 GiB)
         * killall etcd; ../../etcd-v2.2.1-linux-amd64/etcd &

Setting up the DPDK environment
-------------------------------
